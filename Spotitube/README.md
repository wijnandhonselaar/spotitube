Exercise REST and JAX-RS
=========================
Resources
-------------
The following resources are convenient during the exercise:

* DEA Slides: Java EE Domain Layer 
* Chapter 4 and 14 from Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Fowler)
* IntelliJ (or Eclipse) and Tomcat8
* Chrome with the [PostMan REST Client-plugin](https://www.getpostman.com/)
 
In this exercise you'll learn:
------------------------------
*  how to deal with different mediatypes like text/pain and application/json
*  how to use Jersey and Jackson for mapping POJOs to and from JSON
*  how to build a REST resource using different HTTP verbs like GET, POST and DELETE 

Steps
-----
1. Download [Tomcat8](http://apache.proserve.nl/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.0.27/bin/apache-tomcat-8.0.27.zip "Tomcat8"). Unzip this file in a directory of choice (there are known issues with paths containing spaces, you're safe when you unzip this file in the root of your C-disk (Windows), Applications Folder (Mac) or /opt folder (Linux).   
2. Open the Project (pom.xml) in your IDE. The next steps will assume you've used IntelliJ, but we'll guess it still works in any IDE that supports [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/ "Maven") and [Tomcat8](http://tomcat.apache.org/ "Tomcat8"). 
3.  Add a new Jersey configuration called <code>RestConfig</code>. Make your it extends <code>ResourceConfig</code> and let it look for REST resources in the package <code>oose.dea.services.rest</code>. Let this configuration match the application path "/rest".
4. Add a new REST Resource: create a class <code>ItemResource</code> and register "/items" as the default path. Add a method <code>String getTextItems()</code> that:

	* returns a hardcoded String "bread, butter".  
	* matches a GET request
	* produces plain text

5. Build the project using your IDE or Maven (mvn package). Before your can run your application in Tomcat you need to attach Tomcat to IntelliJ/Eclipse. Watch the [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/141192171 "Screencast") to learn how to use Tomcat in IntellJ. There's also a [Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-yKgQtpbco "available") to learn how to use Tomcat in Eclipse. 
6. Now run the application with Tomcat. Visit [http://localhost:8080/rest/items](http://localhost:8080/rest/items) with the PostMan plugin. 
7. Add a new method to the <code>ItemResource</code> called <code>String getJsonItems()</code> that:

	* returns a hardcoded JSON String "{ "bread", "butter" }"
	* matches a GET request
	* produces JSON

8. Build the project and run it with Tomcat. 
Visit [http://localhost:8080/rest/items](http://localhost:8080/rest/items) with the PostMan plugin. You see plain text output, don't you? Change the HTTP-header Accept to application/json and try again.

9. Add an attribute *items* of type <code>List\<Item></code> to <code>ItemResource</code> and fill this list with two or more instances of type <code>Item</code>. Adjust the method <code>getTextItems</code> to loop through the item-list and return a text-based representation. Rebuild the project and test the application again. Does it still work?

10. Now change the method <code>getJsonItems</code> to return a JSON-representation of the item-list. Use Jackson's ObjectMapper to do the trick: 

	<pre>
	ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
	return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(items);
	</pre>

	Rebuild the project and test the application again.

11. Hey, we're using Jersey! It has a built in ability to map objects to JSON using Jackson. Change the signature of the <code>getJsonItems</code> method so it returns a List of items. Implement the method just to return the item-list, without manually converting them to JSON. Wait, before rebuilding your project you have to modify the <code>RestConfig</code>:

	<pre>
	property("jersey.config.server.provider.packages", "com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json;service");
	</pre>
	
	Now rebuild your application and test the application again.
	
12. Add a method <code>Item getJsonItem(String sku)</code> to find a certain item using its sku. Of course it has to return JSON. TIP: You might need annotations liks <code>@Path</code> and <code>@PathParam</code>. 

13. To close this exercise, add void methods to:
	* add a new Item (TIP: Use <code>@Consumes</code> instead of <code>@Produces</code>)
	* delete an existing Item 

    Notice that however the methods are void methods, there is in fact a HTTP Response: 204 (NO CONTENT).

14. When you don't see any effect of adding or deleting items consider making the <code>ItemResource</code> <code>@javax.inject.Singleton</code>, which ensures only one instance of the REST resource instead of creating a new instance every request.
